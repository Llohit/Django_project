To create a new project:
-create a virtual env using cmd "python -m venv venv"
-install all the dependencies inside the venv environment example
pip install django
pip install djangorestframework

settings.py
-It consists of all the config info that Django requires wrt the application built

wsgi (Web Server Gateway Interface)
-This is the medium thru which the application communicates with server requests.
-It handles standard HTTP requests and responses from-to application.
-The wsgi server receives the request and passes it to app, the app processes the request
and sends the respnse back to the server, the server then sends the resp to the client(browser).
-It only handles sync process (One request at a time).

asgi (Async Server Gateway Interface)
- Also handles async process (Multiple req at a time)
- Rest all same as wsgi

python manage.py makemigrations
-creates an migration file to describe changes

python manage.py migrate
-does the actual changes like creating/updating table

In serializer many=True is used when there are list of objects which needs to be
serialized example:

[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "johndoe@example.com"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Jane Doe",
        "email": "janedoe@example.com"
    }
]

When you have single object to serialize don't use many=True
e.g
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "John Doe",
        "email": "johndoe@example.com"
    }

In serializer partial=True is used when we want to accept partial data from user.
